## This repo contains:
* This README
* A jQuery, Moment.js, and Bootstrap time-blocking/planner web application that utilizes color coding for easy user-identification of the current time, labeled time blocks, and a save button for each hour block.
* A stylesheet, and the jQuery file planner.js

## Known Issues / Bugs
* localStorage doesn't seem to be supported in the Safari web browser and makes the clear schedule button and the save function inoperable.

## What I Learned:
* Third Party APIs allow you to focus on developing the important parts of your application, rather than having to spend lots of time reading documentation and programming it yourself.
* jQuery allows for rapid development of your web application and simplifies what usually would take much more work using vanilla JS.

## Conclusion:
* Cross-Browser compatibility is a huge deal when developing potentially popular web applications and testing compitability which popular browsers is very important.
